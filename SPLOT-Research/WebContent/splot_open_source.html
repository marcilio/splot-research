						Now you can:
						<ul>
						<li><a href="#">Extend SPLOT to create your SPL tool, host SPLOT locally with your extensions, and request us to add a link to your work, or</a></li>
						<li><a href="#">Extend SPLOT to create your SPL tool, commit your code extensions to the code repository, and see your tool as part of SPLOT</a></li>
						</ul>
						</p>
						
						<p>Ever since SPLOT's was launched in May/2009, we have received several requests to share SPLOT's source code 
						mostly as a means to support researchers to build new Software Product Line tools.
						We're happy to announce that SPLOT's source code is now available to interested academic and industrial parties. 						
						</p>
						<p>As a researcher or SPL enthusiastic you can download SPLOT's source code and use the available functionality to build or enhance 
						your own SPL tool. Most importantly you can integrate your tool seamlessly with SPLOT and realize the benefits of having 
						the large SPLOT's community using your tool and providing feedback.
						As reported in <a href="/SPLOT/SplotAnalysesServlet?action=display_repository_statistics">our statistics page</a>, SPLOT has 
						been visited regularly by a large number of research groups worldwide since its launch in May,2009.

					<div class="entry">
						<p>
						SPLOT uses <a href="http://freemarker.sourceforge.net/">freemarker</a>, a template engine that generates text output based on templates. 
						Freemarker enables the MVC pattern on SPLOT allowing for a clear separation between HTML formatting and program logic.
						You will need to familiarize yourself a bit with freemarker before extending SPLOT's functionality. 
						Thankfully freemarker is a simple language very similar to other server-based script languages such as JSP and ASP.
						</p>		
						<p>
						SPLOT uses its own Web framework to handle HTML requests and responses. There are two basic framework concepts that need to be understood:
						<i>Servlets</i> and <i>Handlers</i>. A Servlet is simply a Java <a href="">Servlet</a> that registers one
						or more Handlers. You typically need a single Servlet to extend SPLOT but one or more Handlers might be required. Currently, SPLOT uses 
						three Servlets and several handlers. A <i>Handler</i>
						handles a specific functionality invoked via HTTP such as checking the consistency of a feature model, or counting the number of valid configurations,
						or completing automatically a partial feature model configuration. The granularity of a Handler is up to the developer. Handlers must be attached
						to a Servlet and invoked using the "action" attribute as part of the HTTP request parameters that indicates the handler's name. 
						Most of the Handlers are associated with a freemarker
						HTML template and thus extend the FreemarkerHandler class. Such handlers simply build a freemarker model that is automatically
						combined with the template file to produce the final HTML output. For examples of Handlers check SPLOT packages 
						<i>splot.services.handlers</i>. You can also see examples of freemarker templates in 
						<i>/WebContent/WEB-INF/templates</i>.						
						</p>
						
						<p>
						It is mandatory that you create your new extensions (classes and freemarker templates) within the extension folders provided. 
						New Servlets and handlers must be added to 
						package <b>splot.services.extensions.yourpackage</b>, where yourpackage is a package created to host your extensions. New 
						freemarker templates must
						be added to <b>/WebContent/WEB-INF/templates/extensions/yourtemplatesfolder</b>, where <i>yourtemplatesfolder</i> host your templates.
						</p>
						<p>
						Since we're still working on a better documentation the best way to learn how to extend SPLOT is actually browsing the source 
						code and <a href="http://www.marcilio-mendonca.com/contact_splot.asp">bugging us</a>.
