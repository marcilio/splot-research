					S.P.L.O.T. is a completely free and research-oriented service that aims primarily at promoting advances in the field of 
					Software Product Lines. To date, S.P.L.O.T.'s feature model repository represents one of world's largest public repositories 
					entirely contributed by researchers, practitioners and SPL enthusiasts worldwide. The anyone-can-edit-and-share-a-model 
					approach has proven highly successful not only for model creators but especially for those interested in studying 
					third-party models. We hope that the feature model repository continues to grow in the next years and look forward 
					to have larger models as well as models from relevant industrial projects. 					
					</p>
					<p>We take this change to invite SPL research groups worldwide to collaborate with us in our quest to 
					provide public online tools to our exciting ever-growing Software Product Line community.</p>

					<p>
						Canada leads the number of visits to S.P.L.O.T. in the last 12 months thanks to the generous colleagues from Waterloo :-).
						Thank you guys! Yet, we can never forget Canadian researchers from Burnaby, Victoria, Vancouver, and Surrey. 
						Brazil appears in second spot with Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Recife and Fortaleza accounting for more than 50% 
						of the visits. Europe is represented by renowned Software Product Line research groups 
						from Spain, Germany, UK, Belgium, and Denmark, Austria, France and Ireland. 
						The USA also brought regular visitors from California, Illinois, 
						New York, and Florida throughout the year. We also registered visitors from Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, and South Corea 
						among many others countries.

				<div class="entry">
					<p>
						Quite expectedly, S.P.L.O.T.'s front page was the most visited page representing the entry point for visitors. 
						However, it's the feature model repository that
						has really appealed to researchers and practitioners accounting for more than 2,200 pageviews. The feature model editor
						has also been very popular and we hope to attract even more users in the following months with new exciting features. 
						The automated analysis tool was visited regularly by specific research groups that carry out research on automated 
						tools for feature models analysis. 
						Product configuration was also popular especially after we have
						integrated edition, analysis and configuration into a single interface at the feature model editor. 
						Finally, the SXFM format 
						(S.P.L.O.T.'s feature model XML format) page and the feature model generator tool also welcomed loyal visitors.

				<div class="entry">
					<p>
						Oddly enough, Firefox and Google Chrome accounted for more than 88% of the browsers used to visit S.P.L.O.T.
						Why do researches dislike IE? :-) The good news is that S.P.L.O.T. is much faster on Safari, Firefox and Chrome (in this order) ;-)
